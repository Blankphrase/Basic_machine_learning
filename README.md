Theory - Computation - Interpretation

This page is dedicated to make some contribution to fill in the gap among theorists, data analysts and general algorithm users. If you have any comments on the topics or find any mistakes, shoot me an email. 
I plan to cover each topic with a brief theoretical introduction, matlab code with deep explanation of the input and output and possible examples.

Principle component analysis

Theoretical introduction.
Matlab code.
Independent component analysis

Theoretical introduction.
Matlab code.
Canonical correlation analysis

Theoretical introduction.
